# Market Basket Analysis with Python

Data science and machine learning find diverse applications across various fields, one of which is the retail business. As a retail business owner, understanding customer purchasing patterns can significantly impact sales and marketing strategies. Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a powerful technique in data science used to uncover associations between products frequently purchased together by customers. This GitHub repository provides a step-by-step guide on performing Market Basket Analysis using Python.

## Introduction

In this project, we delve into Market Basket Analysis to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior. We utilize Python libraries to analyze an actual online retail dataset from the UK, exploring transactional data to discover patterns and associations among purchased items.

## About Market Basket Analysis

Market Basket Analysis (MBA) is a data mining technique aimed at discovering purchasing patterns by identifying relationships between products frequently bought together. By understanding these associations, retailers can optimize marketing strategies, improve product placements, and enhance customer experiences.
